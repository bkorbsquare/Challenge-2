## Description

- This code displays my portfolio.
- I wanted to deploy this site so that potential employers know valuable information about me.
- I coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Handlebars.js to template out my different sections. I incorporated Bootstrap navbars in my header & footer. 
- In the future I would like to add an English/Spanish switch like my Light/Dark mode one. I'm sure there are other features I will want to include, and I'm more than open to suggestions.

## Description

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website serves as an introduction to me, Brandon Krussow, and showcases my work and skills. Here's what you can expect:

- **Content:** The site provides valuable information about me, my projects, and my skills.
- **Technologies:** I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website. Handlebars.js was employed for templating different sections, and Bootstrap navbars were integrated into the header and footer.
- **Future Enhancements:** In the future, I plan to add an English/Spanish language switch similar to my Light/Dark mode toggle. I'm open to suggestions for additional features.
